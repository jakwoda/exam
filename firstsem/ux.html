The last theme was something I was looking forward to as I am interested in semiotics, perception and user experience is really close to those matters. I learned to write those kind of test, how to conduct interviews and most importantly how to make pitches, sketches and documentation. I feel like it was week where we really learned how to work in groups.</p><p> Although making adjustments to fronter for more then 3 weeks was exhausting and we didnâ€™t have a chance to polish any of our solutions it was a pleasure for me to work on those topics.</p> The one thing I did not expect in that theme was that I learned how to use CSS and HTML better especially the grid system. I think by this point I understand those two languages. Also was making prototypes in XD and with help of UI kits it was really fast and easy. <p>I think it would be more beneficial if we worked on smaller apps/solutions then fronter as it was sometimes hard to get good results with only part of the solution made. For better or worse having one-two user journeys made user tests really basic. </p>
