					<p>Title of the short movie</p> Do's and Don´ts

					<p>The Theme </p> Surviving a day on a bike in Copenhagen <p>Logline</p>
					<p>Jak, the protagonist wants to spend fun Saturday but doesn´t know the rules of Copenhagen streets. Angela is his guide, who teaches him how to ride in Copenhagen the right way. When Jak does something wrong Angela explains it to him and rewinds the time to let him correct his mistake. Treatment In the opening scene we see our protagonist Jak sleeping covered with a blanket and with a pillow behind his head.After the covers go off we see Jak standing on bike; he preceeds to wash his teeth and rides to grab a breakfast. On his way he has to turn right, but he doesn´t show the hand sign. Angela stops him, tells the first rule and makes the time rewind. Now Jak makes the turn properlly and he can buy coffee and donut. He spends rest of the day learning other rules and having great time outside. Not every time he breaks the rule something bad happens but.At night Angela says that he should have his lights on all the time and it rewinds all the way to the begginning. </p>
					<p>Movie stylistic reminds of tv show, instructional video. It does not have a strong plot instead presents rules one by another. It aims to be calm and visually pleasing treat with elements of comedy and documentary. With natural light and neutral colors.That may change only during the time rewinnding parts with addition of video effects. The movie is mainly recorded from a tripod. It enables easy editing during making the time rewind effect. Dynamic shots are recorded with an iphone with stabilizer. All shots are in landscape mode. It does not involve any words only subtitles with biking rules presented by Angela. It will feature a soundtrack with strong miscellaneous soundscape sounds recorded on site and weak dialogue and effects. Short story, with short production time. It should be filmed in one day so the natural light matches and to keep it real.</p>
