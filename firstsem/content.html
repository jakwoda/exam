					<p>At the start of this group task I really wanted to encourage everyone to get involved in developing the concept for our story because I wanted it to be group idea, effort and to get everyone motivated to do something fun and decent. I thought that learning how to work in group is the main goal of this exercise. I was aiming documentary or television show direction but the rest was a bit scared of that unknown land. Due to my previous experience with video I was chosen to direct, record,edit , and play the main part in the video as everybody else didn’t want to stand in front of the camera. Our graphic section created storyboards based on that brainstorm. </p>
					<p>

						I also made still pictures but my group decided to use stock. We recorded the video in one day and got way less shots then I planned. I wanted to teach my colleagues some basic of filmmaking and really I didn’t have a choice as I needed someone to operate the camera. The “VFX” were based of repeated static shots which I tried to explain to my crew. I don’t think they understood me correctly as the camera angle and settings were dynamically changing most of our shots.
						<p>
							Then I edited the video in a funny manner with and I named it dub mix as I inserted dubbed sounds and dub reageee sound track. All in all I learned a lot about working in group. Making videos with other people and pitching your ideas.
						</p>

						<p>The group was chosen randomly and there were some friction in there from day zero. That was probably the most challenging part and I learned a lot from that. </p>
						<p> I wanted our site to be coherent and help one man coding team with designing and coding it. He followed thee principles of simplicity, contrast and hardly needed any help.</p>

						Our aim was to make something really simple and have some fun with acting we didn’t have that much time for that task. We quickly had that idea of a person that gets likes other people’s misfortune.
					</p>

					<p>
						At first we wanted her to die at the end but justyna the actor playing protagonist said it’s to violent. In that task i learned how to make content fast and not lose much of the quality. We recorded it with an iPhone and dubbed audio from zoom recorder done in post. We tried three different actors for a role of antagonist and the best one we found by accident as he was smoking a cigarette during brake of recording his own story. It was a pleasure working on this project. I recorded audio, partially edited and we all pitched it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Funny thing is that our group consisted of only three people that wanted random groups as the other ones chose for themselves.</p>
