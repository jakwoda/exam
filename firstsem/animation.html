						That theme really appealed to me as I like moving pictures. I tried to focus on coding as much as I could and keep my graphics consistent. Helping other students to learn code made me understand it even more. </p>
					<p>
						The project pools were something I enjoyed as it was fast and goal oriented exercise in groups of two. We had a lot of tasks in those weeks and some of my animations need some refignment but I worked with some really nice people and produced lot of stuff I am proud of and satisfied with the results. I made some pictures move interactively which is what I like in programming.</p>

					<p>I tried to do most of the stuff in that theme based on the same design of pixelated Rop who is comic character that I draw to make it consistent and I did not want to use ready made characters.</p>
					<h2>group interactive animation</h2>

					<p> In the final group project I was part of coding team and I have once more get to know structure of code and java script a little bit better. I really liked the switch with cases(counter) and making easter eggs. </p>
					<p>We might have achieved some better graphic coherence if we tried to argue less. I think our wall-e idea had potential of being pretty and a good cause.</p>
